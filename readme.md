# Midterm

## Criteria For Completion
  1. Each group will create a repository to house this beautiful project.
  2. The theatre holds a number of 24 seats. How you break up the seats per row doesn't matter. As long as there are 24 seats in total.
  3. Users should be able to choose an available seat to reserve and enter their information into a form.
  4. Submitting this form should create an object that represents that user and is associated with that seat.
  5. Break up the tasks among group members. Each person should push their own changes to the repo.
  6. On hover(for reserved seats), make the associated user's information appear on the screen.
  7. These should look **_GREAT_**!

  Bonus: Create a form with at least five separate inputs. Hide all but the first and show the rest only when the previous input is in focus.


###### Go back and refactor the work you've already done once you've gotten the basic functionality worked out! How can you DRY up your code?
